            <p>Our company worked with Laurie during her former career with Chum and Rogers television. Working with our limited budgets, Laurie personally tailored a very dynamic campaign that promoted the brand on TV, with both a regular media buy and a program sponsorship that was an ideal fit for our brand. She also included online creative for a brand micro site. Laurie facilitated the full service experience from production of the TV commercial and Internet creative to web site management and media buying. </p>
            <p>She is an expert in her field and a results-oriented enthusiast. Laurie is the type of sales rep you want to work with; trustworthy, informed and direct.</p>

            <p>We have worked with Linda Pelley for over 12 years, and it has been an absolute pleasure. Linda is an exceptional designer with a fresh style as well as a strong ability to understand the client’s needs.</p>

            <p>Working with terminal Van Gogh within the new field of one-to-one data-driven communications, Linda’s enthusiasm and ability to explore new ways of using design within this approach to marketing is a testament to her skill and her ability to take the fundamentals of design to new areas.</p>
            <p>I have consistently been impressed with her ability to express the client’s needs graphically. She succeeds in understanding their business objectives and converting their requirements to a design that exceed their expectations. She works extremely well with a team, is pro-active in exploring concepts, and always pushes the envelope in terms of what will best capture the essence of a project.</p>

Content Blocks
==============

This application provides a model and the necessary template tags for defining
editable content block areas in the templates. Without any need for initial
data, it can generate the blocks in the database when required. It also
provides an "Edit" link next to the blocks. If JavaScript is enabled and the
included JS class is loaded, these links enable AJAX-based, inline editing
of content right in the page. Otherwise, they become simple links to the admin
area of the selected block.


Installation
------------

To install Content Blocks, include it in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list, under
your project's settings.py file.

To render the content using markdown and show placeholder text when DEBUG is set
to True, the app depends on ``markup`` and ``webdesign`` applications,
included in ``django.contrib``:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.markup',
        'django.contrib.webdesign',

        'content_blocks',
    )

You will also have to create a symbolic link called `content_blocks` in your
`MEDIA_ROOT` folder. It should link to `content_blocks/media`. For example:

    cd <path-to-project-media--root-folder>
    ln -s <path-to-content-blocks>/media/ content_blocks


The second step is to include content_blocks.urls in your urls.py:

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        turl(_(r'^content-blocks/'), include('content_blocks.urls')),
    )

After running ./manage.py syncdb, app will be ready to use.


Template Tags
-------------

Content Blocks can only be used through template tags. To define a block,
simply load the tag library and call it as such:

    {% load content_blocks_tags %}
    {% show_content_block "about" %}

``show_content_block`` only requires the unique identifier name of the block
by default. You can also provide two optional parameters, ``editable`` and
``markup``. If ``editable`` is set to "False", the edit link is omitted.
Similarly, if ``markup`` is set to "False", markdown is not applied to the
content:

    {% show_content_block "about" "False" "False" %}

To enable JavaScript functionality, you should also load the necessary JS
files through the ``load_content_block_js`` template tag:

    {% block javascript %}{% load_content_block_js %}{% endblock %}
